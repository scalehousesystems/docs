## Overview

Compliance scores provide a quantitative measure of your organization's compliance posture, calculated based on detected gaps and security events.

## Score Calculation

Scores are calculated on a scale of 0-100:

- **90-100:** Excellent compliance posture
- **75-89:** Good compliance with minor issues
- **60-74:** Needs improvement
- **Below 60:** Critical issues requiring immediate attention
