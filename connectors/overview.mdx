## What are Connectors?

Connectors are lightweight Windows applications that run on your office computer and sync audit logs from your practice management system (PMS) to ScaleHouse Systems in real-time.

<Info>
Connectors run in the background and require minimal system resources. They sync data every 2 minutes automatically.
</Info>

## How Connectors Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Download and install the connector on a Windows computer with access to your PMS database.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate">
    Generate an activation token in your dashboard and paste it into the connector.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Enter your PMS database credentials (stored securely using Windows DPAPI).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync">
    The connector polls your database every 2 minutes and sends new audit events to the cloud.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security

<Card title="How Credentials are Stored" icon="lock">
  Database credentials are encrypted using **Windows DPAPI** (Data Protection API) and stored locally on the office computer. They are **never sent to the cloud**.
</Card>

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Connector authenticates to ScaleHouse using per-connector API key
2. Connector authenticates to PMS using local encrypted credentials
3. Audit events are signed with HMAC-SHA256 before transmission
4. ScaleHouse validates signature and stores events

## Performance

- **Polling Frequency:** Every 2 minutes (configurable)
- **Batch Size:** Up to 100 events per request
- **Network Usage:** ~10-50 KB per sync (minimal)
- **CPU Usage:** <1% (runs in background)
- **Memory Usage:** ~50-100 MB
