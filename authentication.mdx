  <Step title="Store Securely">
    Store the key in a secure location (password manager, environment variables).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.scalehousesystems.com/v1/connectors
```

### Connector Authentication

Connectors use a different authentication flow:

    In the dashboard, go to **Audit Intelligence → Connectors** and click **"Activate Connector"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Token">
    Copy the activation token (valid for 15 minutes).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate in Connector">
    Paste the token into the connector configuration window.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive API Key">
    The connector receives a permanent API key for ongoing authentication.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Card title="Use Strong Passwords" icon="lock">
    Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enable MFA" icon="shield">
    Enable multi-factor authentication for additional security.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate API Keys" icon="refresh">
    Regularly rotate API keys, especially if they may have been compromised.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Environment Variables" icon="code">
    Never hardcode API keys in your code. Use environment variables instead.

## Session Management

Sessions are managed automatically by Supabase Auth. Sessions expire after 7 days of inactivity or can be manually revoked.

<Warning>
If you suspect your account has been compromised, immediately change your password and revoke all API keys.
